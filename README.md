# Godocs Jinja

Godocs Jinja is a plugin for the Godocs package that provides a Jinja2 based constructor to documentation.

In the moment, this is the only constructor implementation available for that package, so it's usually needed to use it.

## Installation

Here's how to install this package.

``` sh
pip install godocs-jinja

# You most certainly will want the godocs package as well:
pip install godocs
```

## Development

``` sh
python -m venv .venv

.venv/Scripts/activate

pip install .[dev]
```
